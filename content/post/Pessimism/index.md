Scene 1: A glass with water in it. The water is at the half-way mark.
Which leads to a critical question: Is the glass half empty? Or is the glass half full?
What would you choose? Does it matter? After all, either of the above is true.
Scene 2: You are lost in a desert, with a glass of water. The water is at the half-way mark.
I urge you to go back to the same question. What would you choose now? Does it matter?

Chances are that you had a larger tendency to quantify the glass as half empty in the latter
scene than the former. The objective truth remained, the glass contained water to the half-way
mark. However, when we put our glass into context, something changed. A seemingly trivial
binary decision turned out to have far-reaching implications. The truth itself doesn’t change,
but how we interpret it can and may have a huge impact on our further actions. Seeing the
glass as half full is archetypal of an optimist. She focuses on what is there, so much that can be
done with the glass. On the contrary, the pessimist sees the glass as half empty. He sees that
the glass used to be full, and soon he will feel the thirst. Woe is him.

In this time of crisis, all of us will soon have to psychologically tune ourselves to the “new
normal” and the post-COVID world, if we haven’t already. One might argue, as is supported by
conventional wisdom, that every crisis calls for a strategy of “optimism tempered with realism”;
and intuitively “faith”, “belief” and “hope” along with other convenient abstracts make
political, social and economical sense. However, there is a case to be made for the pessimists
and the Eeyores of the world. Defensive pessimists, to be specific. Because when the world
stops spinning, defensive pessimists will be the ones with their feet on Mars, metaphorically
speaking.

Pessimism isn’t just about negative thinking, research has shown that it also includes a focus on
outcomes – that is what you expect will happen in the future. While strategic optimists try to
maintain a positive stance throughout, they might be prone to be guilty of fitting the events to
a positive hypothesis instead of the hypothesis to the events. In the words of Julie Norem, a
psychology professor at Wellesley College and a pioneer of the defensive pessimism theory,
“trying to force positivity is a bad strategy for the truly anxious”.

When people are being defensively pessimistic, they set low expectations, but then they take
the next step which is to think through in concrete and vivid ways what exactly might go wrong.
To delve a little deeper into a defensive pessimists’ mind, imagine you have to speak publicly in
front of an audience. You start feeling anxious about it and start contemplating the disaster.
Maybe you will trip over while walking up the stage, or knock over the coffee mug onto your
dress. The microphone will malfunction, and you’ll get questions from the audience you’ve
never thought of. At the first instance it seems like you’re spiraling down a tar pit and
catastrophizing. However, the way this differs from a garden-variety pessimism is the
constructive adaptation, and the action to safeguard against some of these items on your
checklist of disasters. Defensive pessimism may not help you get rid of your anxiety, but the flip
side is that it keeps your mind anchored and focuses you on things you can control. It helps you
direct your anxiety towards a productive activity. In some sense, you’ve peaked in anxiety
before the actual performance.

Everything comes with caveats of its own, and in the case of pessimism, a social aspect is
certainly something of interest. This tendency can severely affect relationships with people who
fall in the more optimistic basket as constantly practicing it will label you as the harbinger of
gloom. If you’re doing it out loud, other people tend not to like it. They tend to have questions
about your competence. There’s this idea that there’s something wrong with you if all you see
are problems in the world. Although it is okay for someone to just try to be happy, emotional
states by definition are supposed to be transient. You’re going to be happy sometimes, and not
happy sometimes. If your goal is to be happy, the next time you’re not happy, you’ll feel like
you have failed. If you feel anxious and it feels real to you, ignoring it generally doesn’t work
out.

Defensive pessimism, of course, is not for everyone. Those vulnerable to acute and frequent
bouts of anxiety must not look for vindication in negative thinking. You are getting worked up in
the process, it takes energy. If you’re doing it for everything, you’re more likely to wear yourself
out. That said, anxiety is exhausting anyway. But, for a large number of us who keep bouncing
between radically contrasting versions of emotional extrema, defensive pessimism provides a
path that challenges the herd mentality who advocate positivity for the sheer sake of it.

One could argue that defensive pessimism is, at this moment, not just sensible but the need of
the hour. When we heard of the lockdowns, all of us rushed to get the essential supplies
stocked up on the eventuality of a shortage. Because we assumed the worst, we actually got off
and did something about it. I think the real edge a defensive pessimist might have when the
world reopens is that they will continue to take more precautions, and prepare for the roller
coaster of peaks that may happen. They’re less likely to be caught off guard by any of it.

Defensive pessimism does not view the future through rose coloured glasses. It sees a
post-pandemic planet not as a return to paradise but as a place that is still prone to pitfalls and
prejudices, and thus warrants strict caution. By making us aware that things can go wrong at every turn, defensive pessimism is perfect in the sense that a lot of our current misery is
directly a product of our seemingly proud all-knowing ego, and the cultural euphoria that
everything would always eventually be alright.

It will take all sorts to make the desert ahead survivable in case you do actually get lost.
However, the foresight of packing an extra bottle and anticipating the eventuality that water
might run out seems better on face value than holding out to the hope that we will run into an
oasis before the “half full” glass runs out. There’s no correct way to think about things that fit
every situation and every person. You will have to find your own ways in the world. The real
reason thinking positively can work well is because it motivates people to go out and make the
change. If thinking positively leads you to productive action, that’s great. But it doesn’t for
everyone. All this to say that we shouldn’t count the pessimists out. Optimism, as we’ve seen,
can turn dangerously into self-delusion pretty quickly. Indulging in it too frequently might leave
us with nothing to fight for.
