abstract: Implements the Bayesian quantile regression model for binary longitudinal data 
          (QBLD) developed in Rahman and Vossmeyer (2019) <DOI:10.1108/S0731-90532019000040B009>.
          The model handles both fixed and random effects and implements both a blocked
          and an unblocked Gibbs sampler for posterior inference. Project supported by Google summer of code.
