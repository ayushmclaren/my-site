I am Ayush, currently a [Master's of Financial Engineering](https://mfe.haas.berkeley.edu/) candidate at Haas school of Business, UC Berkeley. I completed my Bachelor's degree from the [Maths Dept.](https://www.iitk.ac.in/math/) at IIT-Kanpur. I have gained skills in statistical research & implementation, Math, Programming and Finance through various courses, projects, internships and summer programs. I have also worked as a Technical Product Manager for the Delivery charges & Serviceability teams at [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com/) from June 2021 to Feb 2022. I am looking to apply my skills at Quantitative roles.

Apart from this, I am extremely invested in the Financial markets, specifically in the derivative product space. I have been trading and investing for more than 2 years and would love to hear about your idea of the next big market phenomenon. Ask me anything cars or Formula 1, and I usually cannot shut up about [Mclaren](http://cars.mclaren.com/). I dabble with music, cooking and photography as well. Let's get coffee!
