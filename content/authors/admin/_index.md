I am Ayush, senior undergraduate in the [Maths and Stats](http://www.iitk.ac.in/math/) department at IIT-Kanpur. I knew exactly what love looked like, in seventh grade. Even though I hadn't met love yet, if love had wandered into my homeroom, I would've recognise it at first glance. Love arrived exactly when it was supposed to and I ended up at this wonderful department at IIT-Kanpur. 

I have been actively exploring the areas in Markov Chains, believing my way through Bayesian Statistics and evolving through Time Series. These have often mesmerised me and ignited an insatiable curiosity to learn more. I recently worked on implementing Quantile regression models for binary longitudinal data by [Prof. Arshad Rahman](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~marshad/), which culminated in the[ qbld](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qbld/index.html) package on CRAN. I am currently working on Change-point algorithms, and Kolmogorov tests for Markov Chains with [Prof. Dootika Vats](http://dvats.github.io/), who is the sole reason for my love for this field. 

Apart from this, I am extremely invested in the Financial markets, specifically in the derivative product space. I have been trading and investing for more than 2 years and would love to hear about your idea of the next big market phenomenon. I also have considerable experience in psychology through various courses and projects with [Prof. Devpriya Kumar](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~devpriya/index.htm)(No! I do not read minds, or do I?). Ask me anything cars, and I usually cannot shut up about [Mclaren](http://cars.mclaren.com/). I dabble with music, cooking and photography as well. Let's get coffee!
